## 👨‍💻 Software Developer

Software development is not just my job but also my biggest hobby. Creating things is the best thing in the world, and in software development you don't have any fixed boundaries. That's probably what I like the most.

## 🎸 Musician

I like to play guitar, especially fingerstyle, piano and would like to add saxophone to the list. Currently into modern Jazz, foreign rock/pop and rock/metal.

## 💬 Language Enthusiast

Language opened me doors into entertainment, friends and cultures I didn't even know existed. Since experiencing how just a bit of knowledge in a language broadened my horizon I'm hooked. Currently learning:

-   Mandarin
-   Korean
-   Swedish
-   Japanese
